# Ping7.io check locations
{: .fs-9 }

Use our check locations around the globe to gather a global consensous
of your websites availability.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Always probe from multiple locations

Do not rely on the metrics of a single location. Always probe each target from
multiple locations. Ideally pick an uneven number of locations close to your
website's main target audience.

For a global target audience, use our exporters to test your global routing
and distribution. You could for example check whether your geo location DNS
setup is working properly.
